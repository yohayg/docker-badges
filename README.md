Badges for Docker hub repositories
=========================

Badges! These tiny pictures with label and some numbers, you see them in many GitHub readmes. We all love them, yeah? Travis, Coveralls, Code Climate, Gemnasium, Gem, PyPi, npm… 
However, most of them are not usable for Java/Groovy guys and that’s quite sad, isn’t it?

Well, I put together [shields.io](http://shields.io/), [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and some Ruby code to generate a shiny badge that shows a repository last build status.
